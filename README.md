A website that shows time, but in a Minecraft style :3

I believe this project is self-explanatory; it's just a website that displays the time as a Minecraft clock.

This project started as a simple experiment in selecting the correct clock frame based on time…  
Then it got animations…  
Then timezone support…  
Until it became a fun little website.
