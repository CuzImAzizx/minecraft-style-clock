# Minecraft Style Clock

A website showing time, but in Minecraft style :3

I believe this project is self-explanatory, it's just a website that displays the time as Minecraft clock.

This project started as a simple experiment in selecting the correct clock frame based on time…  
Then it got animations…  
Then timezone support…  
Until it became a fun little website.
